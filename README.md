# pdxfiber.com

Hi!

This is the public, open-source repository for [pdxfiber.com](https://www.pdxfiber.com/), an initiative to bring municipal fiber internet access to the Portland, Oregon area.

We'd love to have your thoughts, ideas, or contributions. Before engaging, we invite you to review our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [licensing information](LICENSE.md).

## Getting Started

We use the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) CMS to manage our site, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host it.

If you're making changes locally, you can easily use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) as a preview. If you don't have it installed, it's available as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler):

```console
$ gem install [--user-install] bundler
```

To install all dependencies locally (you only need to run this when you update the repository or change the `Gemfile`):

```console
$ bundle install
```

To run a development server that automatically rebuilds the site files when you make a change:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Point your browser to <http://localhost:4000> to see the site!

When you're ready for your changes to be integrated, open a [pull request](https://github.com/pdxfiber/pdxfiber.com/pulls). We'll review it as quickly as possible.

For more complex changes, we may defer a review until one of our in-person meetings, which are open to everyone and happen weekly with the [Personal Telco Project](https://personaltelco.net/). You can find all of our upcoming meetings [on our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/PDX-Fiber/).

## Questions?

We have an active IRC and Matrix (bridged) chatroom. Please feel free to join us to ask any questions you might have, both about policy and open-source contributions!
