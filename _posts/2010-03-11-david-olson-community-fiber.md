David Olson, Director of the Cable Franchise Management Office, discusses open-access community fiber, and the City’s response to Google.

[Here’s a great piece](https://web.archive.org/web/20050913030926/http://wweek.com/html/leada081199.html) the Willamette Week did back in ’99 about David and the City’s battle with AT&T (now Comcast). You’ll note the similarities between what we face now, with no fiber in Portland while Verizon customers in Washington County have it, and the situation with slow broadband rollouts a decade ago.
