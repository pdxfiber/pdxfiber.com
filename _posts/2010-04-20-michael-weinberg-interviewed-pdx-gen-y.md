<del>Yesterday, Michael Weinberg was interviewed on the pdx.fm show PDX Gen-Y by Bret Bernhoft about the importance of Google Fiber and Portland Fiber in general. Michael does a great job of explaining why open-access freedom and high capacity are so important to the future of Portlanders. Worth a listen.</del>

**Update:** Unfortunately, as of 2018, this interview is no longer available online.
