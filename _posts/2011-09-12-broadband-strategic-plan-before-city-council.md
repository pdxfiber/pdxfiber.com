At 2 p.m. on September 14, the Portland City Council will consider adoption of a [Broadband Strategic Plan](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/73862) ([Resolution 974](http://efiles.portlandoregon.gov/Record/4669112/File/Document/)). The plan has been prepared over the last year by the [Office of Cable Communications and Franchise Management](http://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/57435). Wednesday will be an opportunity for people to testify to City Council about the plan prior to the vote on adoption. If you care about the poor state of Broadband availability, capacity and pricing in Portland, if you hope someday to be rescued from the mire of mediocrity and monopoly abuse, please consider taking action, by attending this session and letting City Council know how vital it is to solve these problems. Testimony can be 3 minutes, there is a sign up sheet by the door to Council Chambers before the session ([see the official rules](http://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/63123?#2)).
