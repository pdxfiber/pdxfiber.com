> So far, Sandy residents seem solidly behind the project. In a survey the city conducted to gauge interest in building the network, one resident wrote, “I am so proud to be part of a city that is this forward thinking.”

[The Oregonian is reporting](http://www.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty/index.ssf/2011/07/sandy_fiber_internet_project_t.html) that the City of Sandy, Oregon is moving ahead with a municipal fiber network, as other communities have in various ways around the country and around the world. You know, living here in Portland, I sorely wish I could be proud too.
