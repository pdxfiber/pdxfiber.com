<del>As of a few days ago, the City has posted <a disabled>a draft Broadband Strategic Plan</a>. I encourage everyone to read the document and then <a disabled>to comment on it</a> and to point out where it comes up short.</del>

Portland needs to invest in scarcity-squashing infrastructure. The City has built its own fiber infrastructure for governmental use. It’s time for the City to look out for its citizens and let them own their own infrastructure as well. The public stands to reap enormous benefits, both in avoiding perpetual rent and by enabling competition in service providers on the infrastructure. Don’t let this opportunity slip by.

**Update:** As of 2018, this draft is no longer available. [Portland's Broadband Strategic Plan](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/revenue/73862) was unanimously adopted in the fall of 2011.
