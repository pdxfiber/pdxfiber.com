Wm Leler forwarded a link to [an Engadget article analysing why the Europeans have so much cheaper bandwidth than we do](http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/28/why-is-european-broadband-faster-and-cheaper-blame-the-governme/) and blaming our Government. The reason? We allow operators to exclude competition. [As Iâ€™ve said before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-03-31-google-fiber-dead-long-live-portland-fiber %}), Competition is the key to shaking off the abusive fees we have now.
