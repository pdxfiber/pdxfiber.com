Many of us probably already planned to wear green tomorrow, but, this year, please join me in being “Green for Fiber.”

There are a lot of reasons to be green for fiber:

1. High speed networks make telecommuting possible, saving emissions caused by daily commutes.
2. Wearing green on St. Patrick’s Day keeps you from getting pinched. Open-access, community fiber will keep you from getting pinched by ISP bandwidth caps and protocol blocking.
3. High speed networks will encourage new business development, meaning more green in our city.
4. We’re green with envy at cities that already enjoy speeds of 50-100Mbps, and we want them to envy our 1Gbit service.

Whatever your reason, on March 17th, 2010, join me in being green for fiber!
